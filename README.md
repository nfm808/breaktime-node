# Breaktime Node Style

A simple timer written in node to remind you to get off the computer and move around a bit.

## How to use

Clone and then move to the directory

Install dependencies with:  ```npm i```

Replace or add the images or gifs of your choice into the assets folder. 

To run the app:  ```node .```

Enter in how many minutes you want to have before each break prompt and enjoy.

The app waits for you to close the notification before restarting the interval timer and displays your break interval.

When work is done and it's time to end the program: ```^c```
